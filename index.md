## Welcome to my math blog!

I'm not sure how you got here, since I doubt I've mentioned to anyone that this exists yet, and this account doesn't have much connection to anything yet, but welcome! I did feel obligated to make a post about the distributive property for you if you want to take a look, but if not, have a cookie for your troubles (üç™) and feel free to come back at another time and I might have some more content prepared to show you. Take care!
