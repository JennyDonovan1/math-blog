## Welcome to my math blog!

I'm not sure how you got here, since I haven't really publicly announced this in any way yet, and this account doesn't have much connection to anything, but welcome! I mainly made this in preparation for my Summer of Math Exposition entry, but I did feel like I should make a post or two if you want to take a look, but if not, have a cookie for your troubles (üç™) and feel free to come back at another time and I might have some more content prepared to show you. Take care!

(Oh, and if you want to contact me relating to this blog, I can be found at jennydmath@gmail.com.)
